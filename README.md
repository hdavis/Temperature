# Temperature
Repo for Temperature Data Analysis and Visualizations

This repo includes Python code to collect the last 30 days of temperature data from the Dark Sky Forecast web API for select cities in the US, extract the maximum daily temperatures, summarize the data and visualize it using box plots to show the range in maximum daily temperatures over that 30-day period for each city.

This repo also contains files to plot the summary data on a web map, located at: https://hdavis.github.io/Temperature/max_temps.html.

To see the Python code and box plots, open the Jupyter/IPython Notebooks: "Temperature.ipynb" for a Python 2 version or "Temperature_Python3_Version.ipynb" for the same notebook updated to Python 3.
